  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="content">
    Currently, not many African languages are supported on existing
    word processors. IsiZulu, IsiXhosa, Sepedi, SeSotho, Setswana,
    TshiVenda, XiTsonga, IsiNdebele and IsiSwati are collectively
    known as Bantu languages and are the largest language group in
    South Africa. Within these Bantu languages exists a sub-group
    known as Nguni wherein the language being focused on-isiXhosa - is found.
    According to the 2011 census of South
    Africa, approximately 8.1 million people speak isiXhosa which
    accounts for 16% of the population of South Africa, second to
    23% of isiZulu speakers in South Africa.
    This project aimed to create a spellchecker for isiXhosa that
    can correctly perform isolated non-word error detection as there
    is currently no standalone spellchecker for isiXhosa. Secondly,
    this project aimed to investigate the accuracy of the isiXhosa
    spellchecker and assess whether it can achieve the same accuracy
    or exceed that of the standalone isiZulu spellchecker created by
    Ndaba et al. [13] which has an accuracy of 89%.

  </p>

  <h2>System Design & Implementation</h2>
  <p class="content">
  The error detector used n-gram analysis, particularly character trigrams.
  These trigrams were created from the word corpus received from Dr Mantoa-Masoko (the
  client) which was combined with an online corpus downloaded from the North West University digital languages
  resources website which can be found
  <a href="https://rma.nwu.ac.za/index.php/catalogsearch/result/?q=isiXhosa+NCHLT+Text+Corpora"><strong> here </strong></a> .

  The corpus has to be clean and prepared for use by the spellchecker. This is an important step as the
  documents used to create the corpus directly affect the performance of the spellchecker.
  A clean corpus is one which does not contain words of another language and punctuation.
  A cleaner corpus leads to better results. Although no spellchecker is 100% accurate, clean and
  large corpora improve the performance of the spellchecker.
  A trigram is a set of 3 consecutive characters. For example, if the input word is
  “Molweni”, for trigrams the output would be “Mol”, “olw”,
  “lwe”, “wen”, “eni”. In addition to storing these tree structures , the frequency of each n-gram was
  stored as a key-value pair.<br/>

   <p class="content2">A user interface design that was as
  simple as possible was creted in order to avoid overwhelming and cluttering
  the user. The design process followed was expert-mindset.<br/>
  To evaluate the usability and look of the spellchecker, a
  usability study was conducted. A group of participants that
  comprised of students at the University of Cape Town who study
  isiXhosa at university level or have studied IsiXhosa until grade
  12 were asked to partake in the usability testing. The testing
  session was 30 minutes long. During this time, users were
  observed as they used the tool to see how quickly they could
  understand the tasks to be completed and how they proceeded to
  begin and complete the task. Users were allowed to give feedback
in​ ​ real-time​ ​ as​ ​ they​ ​ used​ ​ the​ ​ tool​ ​ during​ ​ the​ ​ study </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p class="content">
    The statistical approach for the isiXhosa spellchecker performs
    poorly in comparison to the isiZulu spellchecker. This approach
    was chosen as it was used by Ndaba et al. [13] for the isiZulu
    spellchecker and performed very well giving an accuracy of 89%.
    With isiXhosa and isiZulu belonging to the same language group,
    the Nguni group. The two languages have similarities in their language
    structure thus, it was expected that the statistical approach would work well for
    both languages but the isiXhosa error detector performed worse in comparison to the
    isiZulu error detector achieving an accuracy of 79%. It was  also established that despite the
    similarities in the language, the isiZulu trigrams cannot be used for the isiXhosa trigrams.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="content">
    This project aimed to create a
    data-driven statistical based model to perform isolated non-word
    error detection for an isiXhosa spellchecker. This tool was
    successfully created as a desktop application and achieves an
    accuracy of 79%. A secondary aim of this project was to
    investigate whether the isiXhosa spellchecker can achieve an
    accuracy similar to that of the isiZulu spellchecker. The isiXhosa
    spellchecker gave a lower accuracy or 79% in comparison with
    the isiZulu spellchecker which has an accuracy of 89%.
